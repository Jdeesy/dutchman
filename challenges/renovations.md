# The Renovations Challenge

It stinks having to reload the page to see any changes to the status of the stock room or the buffet.  Modify the Frying Dutchman program to asynchronously update these stats, and the status of the shrimp deliveries, when the `Restock Shrimp` or `Refill Buffet` buttons are pressed (you can start by putting any javascript in the `the_frying_dutchman/app/assets/javascripts/application.js` file).
